/*
    Rust’s floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size,
    respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, it’s roughly the same
    speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
